% We try to prove that every group is commutative.

% e is the neutral element.
fof(a1, axiom, ! [X] : mult(e,X) = X).

% For every element X there is a left inverse element Y.
fof(a2, axiom, ! [X] : ? [Y]: mult(Y, X) = e).

% The law of associativity holds.
fof(a3, axiom, ! [X,Y,Z] : mult(mult(X, Y), Z) = mult(X, mult(Y, Z))).

% Question: Does the law of commutativity hold?
fof(commute, conjecture, ! [X, Y] : mult(X, Y) = mult(Y, X)).
