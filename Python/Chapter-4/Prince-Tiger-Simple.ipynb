    "Once upon a time there was a king who wanted to marry his daughter to a prince. He had it announced throughout the country that he was looking for a husband for his daughter. One day a prince came along to apply. Since the king did not want to marry his daughter to some dumbass, the king led the prince into a room with 3 doors. The king told the prince that the princess would be in one of the rooms, but that there was another room behind which a hungry tiger would be waiting. One room would be empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further the king said that at all doors signs had been attached. These signs contained a statement that was either true or false.  Furthermore,\n",
    "- in the room, where a tiger is inside, the statement, which is written on the sign, \n",
    "  is wrong.\n",
    "- In the room where the princess is, the statement is correct.\n",
    "- In the empty room, the statement is either true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prince then read the inscriptions. They were as follows:\n",
    "* Room 1: Room three is empty.\n",
    "* Room 2: The tiger is in the first room.\n",
    "* Room 3: This room is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The task becomes easy if you use appropriate propositional variables to encode the king's statements and the inscriptions on the rooms. In my solution, I used the following variables:\n",
    "- $\\mathtt{ùôø}i$ is true if and only if the princess is in the $i^\\mathrm{th}$ room.  \n",
